Implement some sort of search tree
with nodes
and the nodes holding some sort of data or something
Node {
    parent
    children
    NodeData {
        id
        real distance to parent
        heuristic distance to goal
    }
}

path type
+ first
+ prepend(Node)
+ reverse

SearchTree type
+ ctor()
+ ctor(NodeData)
+ rootNode
+ isEmpty

A*-node data type

implement the A* algorithm somehow
using a generic search algorithm thingie as the base or something

put in some example stuff that actually works
akin to the map of cities in romania used in the text book

README.md
-> add instructions as to how to clone the repo (--recursive)
-> add instructions as to how to build
-> GNU/Linux only!
-> Prerequisites: git, CMake, g++-8, doxygen, clang-format etc. and how to install them
-> descriptions for the files / directories

add nodiscard

consider enabling compiler optmiziations if shit gets slow or something

add documentation
